# ** Next.js API Lab - Form Validation & Customer Data Visualization**

## Customer Data Visualization & Interaction:

**1_** A customers table was created using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for styling.
**2_** A delete button feature allows for the removal of customer entries.
**3_** Clicking a customerâ€™s name displays their details in a Tailwind-styled card view.
**4_** A real-time search feature was implemented using client-side filtering, fetching all data once and updating the display as the search term changes.
**5_** Global styling and consistent UI structure are managed using Next.js's _app.js and _document.js files.

This project has enhanced my skills in React Hooks, API integration, and modern UI design, preparing me for solving real-world challenges.
