# ** Next.js API Lab - Form Validation & Customer Data Visualization**

## Customer Data Visualization & Interaction:

**1.** A customers table was created using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for styling.  
**2.** A delete button feature allows for the removal of customer entries.  
**3.** Clicking a customerâ€™s name displays their details in a Tailwind-styled card view.  
**4.** A real-time search feature was implemented using client-side filtering, fetching all data once and updating the display as the search term changes.  
**5.** Global styling and consistent UI structure are managed using Next.js's _app.js and _document.js files.
