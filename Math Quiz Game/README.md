## Math Quiz Game

## Overview
The Math Quiz Game is a simple interactive application designed to help kids aged 7 to 12 practice basic math operations in a fun and engaging way. The game generates random math problems (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) and provides instant feedback on the player's answers. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library, making it easy to use and visually appealing.
